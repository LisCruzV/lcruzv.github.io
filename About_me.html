  <p class="quote">About Me</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I’m a professional with a master’s degree in Business Administration and Bachelor’s in Economics.
    Since August 2022, I have been working towards accrediting a Business Intelligence certificate from Wake Tech
    Community College on May 2023.<br>
    My experience has allowed me to successfully develop skills such as operating in a robust customer service
    environment, excellent problem-solving, team collaboration, and excellent communication skills in a multicultural
    environment.<br>
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="paragraph">I am passionate about helping people—an enthusiastic, creative, reliable, and hard-working
    person.<br>
    Originally from Mexico, I moved to the United States in 2011. I’m a proud mom of one girl and two boys, a wife, a
    beach lover, and a coffee enthusiast.</p>
  <p class="paragraph"><br>
    Currently, I’m working at Edward Jones as a Branch Administrator and seeking a job opportunity focused on my studies
    as a Business Intelligence analyst. I am eager to learn, excited about new challenges, and ready to take them on.
